	abstract = {Context: GitHub, nowadays the most popular social coding platform, has become the reference for mining Open Source repositories, a growing research trend aiming at learning from previous software projects to improve the development of new ones. In the last years, a considerable amount of research papers have been published reporting findings based on data mined from GitHub. As the community continues to deepen in its understanding of software engineering thanks to the analysis performed on this platform, we believe that it is worthwhile to reflect on how research papers have addressed the task of mining GitHub and what findings they have reported. Objective: The main objective of this paper is to identify the quantity, topic, and empirical methods of research works, targeting the analysis of how software development practices are influenced by the use of a distributed social coding platform like GitHub. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted with four research questions and assessed 80 publications from 2009 to 2016. Results: Most works focused on the interaction around coding-related tasks and project communities. We also identified some concerns about how reliable were these results based on the fact that, overall, papers used small data sets and poor sampling techniques, employed a scarce variety of methodologies and/or were hard to replicate. Conclusions: This paper attested the high activity of research work around the field of Open Source collaboration, especially in the software domain, revealed a set of shortcomings and proposed some actions to mitigate them. We hope that this paper can also create the basis for additional studies on other collaborative activities (like book writing for instance) that are also moving to GitHub.},

A diverse set of stakeholders—representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers—have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	abstract = {The FAIR Guiding Principles, published in 2016, aim to improve the ﬁndability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of digital research objects for both humans and machines. Until now the FAIR principles have been mostly applied to research data. The ideas behind these principles are, however, also directly relevant to research software. Hence there is a distinct need to explore how the FAIR principles can be applied to software. In this work, we aim to summarize the current status of the debate around FAIR and software, as basis for the development of community-agreed principles for FAIR research software in the future. We discuss what makes software different from data with regard to the application of the FAIR principles, and which desired characteristics of research software go beyond FAIR. Then we present an analysis of where the existing principles can directly be applied to software, where they need to be adapted or reinterpreted, and where the deﬁnition of additional principles is required. Here interoperability has proven to be the most challenging principle, calling for particular attention in future discussions. Finally, we outline next steps on the way towards deﬁnite FAIR principles for research software.},
